- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The WatchStack keeps a stack of the modules being watched as files are loaded. If a file in the process of being loaded (parent.rb) triggers the load of another file (child.rb) the stack will ensure that child.rb handles the new constants.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If child.rb is being autoloaded, its constants will be added to autoloaded_constants. If it was being `require`d, they will be discarded.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is handled by walking back up the watch stack and adding the constants found by child.rb to the list of original constants in parent.rb
