  body: ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber is an object set to consume ActiveSupport::Notifications with solely purpose of logging. The log subscriber dispatches notifications to a regirested object based on its given namespace.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "An example would be Active Record log subscriber responsible for logging queries:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  module ActiveRecord\n    class LogSubscriber &lt; ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber\n      def sql(event)\n        &quot;#{event.payload[:name]} (#{event.duration}) #{event.payload[:sql]}&quot;\n      end\n    end\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "And it's finally registed as:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber.attach_to :active_record\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Since we need to know all instance methods before attaching the log subscriber, the line above should be called after your ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber definition.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: After configured, whenever a &quot;sql.active_record&quot; notification is published, it will properly dispatch the event (ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event) to the sql method.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Log subscriber also has some helpers to deal with logging and automatically flushes all logs when the request finishes (via action_dispatch.callback notification) in a Rails environment.
