  body: Returns a string representing the object's key suitable for use in URLs or nil if model.persisted? is false.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Implementers can decide to either raise an exception or provide a default in case the record uses a composite primary key. There are no tests for this behavior in lint because it doesn't make sense to force any of the possible implementation strategies on the implementer. However, if the resource is not persisted?, then to_param should always return nil.
