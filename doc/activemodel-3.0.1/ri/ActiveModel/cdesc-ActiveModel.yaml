  text: Active Model Lint Tests
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You can test whether an object is compliant with the Active Model API by including <tt>ActiveModel::Lint::Tests</tt> in your TestCase. It will include tests that tell you whether your object is fully compliant, or if not, which aspects of the API are not implemented.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: These tests do not attempt to determine the semantic correctness of the returned values. For instance, you could implement valid? to always return true, and the tests would pass. It is up to you to ensure that the values are semantically meaningful.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Objects you pass in are expected to return a compliant object from a call to to_model. It is perfectly fine for to_model to return self.
