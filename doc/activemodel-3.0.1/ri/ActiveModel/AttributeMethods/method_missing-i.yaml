- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Allows access to the object attributes, which are held in the <tt>@attributes</tt> hash, as though they were first-class methods. So a Person class with a name attribute can use Person#name and Person#name= and never directly use the attributes hash -- except for multiple assigns with ActiveRecord#attributes=. A Milestone class can also ask Milestone#completed? to test that the completed attribute is not <tt>nil</tt> or 0.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It's also possible to instantiate related objects, so a Client class belonging to the clients table with a <tt>master_id</tt> foreign key can instantiate master through Client#master.
