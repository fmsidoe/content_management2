- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Add a preparation callback. Preparation callbacks are run before every request in development mode, and before the first request in production mode.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If a symbol with a block is given, the symbol is used as an identifier. That allows to_prepare to be called again with the same identifier to replace the existing callback. Passing an identifier is a suggested practice if the code adding a preparation block may be reloaded.
