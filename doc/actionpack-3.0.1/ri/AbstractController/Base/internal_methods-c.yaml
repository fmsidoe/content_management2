  body: A list of all internal methods for a controller. This finds the first abstract superclass of a controller, and gets a list of all public instance methods on that abstract class. Public instance methods of a controller would normally be considered action methods, so we are removing those methods on classes declared as abstract (ActionController::Metal and ActionController::Base are defined as abstract)
